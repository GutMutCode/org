#+title: Intro

* Introduction
** These are the algoritms I have ran into
My goal is foundation

** Why should I care about algoritms?
- Isn't asking algoritms old fashion for interviews?
- I don't actually use any of them on the job right?

** Let me ask you this
What data structure is used here (answer in your head)?
#+begin_src javascript
const a = [];
#+end_src

This isn't array

Arrays are the simpliest Data Structure

** Time and Space Complexity
- There will be no proofs
- There will be graphs though

** Why TypesScript?
- I do not like typescript for datastructures, but I chose it to make this class the most beginner friendly class
