* Socket Programming
** Syntax
*** The way to use functions
The reason of use this function
|> Network
|> OSI 7 Layer
|> TCP/IP Socket

** The way to design protocol
The things that you have to aware.
*** Echo server
*** Chating server

** IOCP
*** Asynchronous File I/O
*** Queue
*** Thread scheduling
Automation by use OS's features.
** Environment
Wireshark => packet analysis
PC more than one => To occur errors intendedly

Cross calbe => load testing

Network Error handling
=> Detach Lan cable from pc.
=> timeout

*** For only one host.
- Many Process
  == Many Socket
  - Server
  - Client

**** Process flow
client process request(L5 or high) =>

client socket(L4) =>
make packet (L3) =>
see ip and transter to a destination =>
receive packet (L3) =>
server socket(L4) =>

server process receive(L5 or high)

*** For Many host.


* Syntax
** Create Worker thread
MS Development Network
#+begin_src c
HANDLE CreateThread(
                    [in, optional] LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpThreadAttributes, [out, optional] LPDWORD lpThreadId
                    );
#+end_src

- LPDWORD
  => Long Pont Double WORD

* Glossary
** 127.0.0.1 == Loopback
** Difference between TCP/UDP
TCP => client/server
UDP => peer to peer

** Thread
*** Window
Execution unit that using the ~cpu~.
**** Have 1MB isolated stack memory in virtual memory
*** Multi threading
Concurruntly execute the program.
*** Main thread
Usually used thread.
**** Any other thread => worker thread

** Process
The thread suite.
- OS =>
  - Allocate virtual memory to process
  - Give process some permission

** Concurreny programming
*** Queue
- Race condition (relevant to sequence of execution)

*** Flow Control
- Insert Control
  - Blocking
- Signal(Event) Control
