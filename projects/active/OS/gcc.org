#+title: GNU Compiler Collection

* What is GCC?
The GNU Compiler Collection includes front ends for C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, Go, and D, as well as libraries for these languages

* Purpose
The compiler for the GNU operating system

* Building GCC
Compilers are upgraded through a process called bootstrapping

** Bootstrap
If your system compiler is not the same major version as the compiler version you wish to build, (if you have 4.6.2 and want 4.7.2), You should bootstrap

1. first compiler - old system compiler that produces slow code
2. second compiler - new version of a slow compiler that produces fast code
3. third compiler - other new a fast compiler that produces fast code

You need to verify the correctness of our new fast compiler that produces fast code
