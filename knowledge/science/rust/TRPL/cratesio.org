* More About Cargoo and Crates.io
So far we've used only the most basic features of Cargo to build, run, and test our code, but it can do a lot more.
In this chapter, we'll discuss some oof its other, more advanced features to show you how to do the following:

- Customize you build through release profiles
- Publish libraries on ~crates.io~
- Organize large projects with workspaces
- Install binaries from ~creates.io~
- Extend Cargo using custoom commands

Cargo can do even more than the functionality we cove in this chapter, so for a full explanation of all its features, see ~its documentation~.
