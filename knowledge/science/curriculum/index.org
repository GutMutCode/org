MIT kind of combined calculus 1&2 into one playlist.
So this link will start off at lecture 27 which is a typical starting point for a calc 2 class

These go along with the lecture

*** More Practice Problems (w/ notes)
http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/DE.aspx

There aren't official assignment problems here like for Calc 1-3, but there are example problems that are explained that you can use as practice problems

* Discrete Math
** Prerequisites
[[Single Variable Calculus / Calculus 1 / Caculus AB][Calc 1]]

** Lectures
*** MIT Opencourseware
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3LMbpZIKhQ&list=PLB7540DEDD482705B

This class is listed as "mathematics for computer science" but pretty much all the materal coverd is what math majors will see in their discrete math/proof class (logic, proofs, number theory, graph theory, etc)
You also do NOT need computer science experience to take tis class and can take it anytime ~after calc 1~

** Assignments
*** With Solutions
https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2005/assignments/

These assignments are from ANOTHER year this course was taught (same material mostly but different order), but they do have solutions.
So you might need to do a little searching sometimes to match up exactly what is taught in the lecture vs what the homework is

*** Without Solutions
https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/assignments/

These assignments go along with the lecture but don't contain solutions

** Textbooks
*** "Electrical Engineering and Computer Science" by Gilbert Strang

https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/readings/MIT6_042JF10_notes.pdf

https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/assignments/
These don't match the lecture exactly but are more organized and contain solutions

*** Without Solutions
https://www.math.hmc.edu/~su/math131/

These assignments are directly from the lecture, but are a little harder to follow and are less organized

** Assignments
*** Lecture Notes and Practice Problems
http://www.supermath.info/AlgebraInotes_2016.pdf

These go with the liberty college lectures.
Currently cannot find assignments for the Harvard one's

*** Solutions to Problems (and some test examples)
http://www.supermath.info/AbstractAlgebra.html
