* Curious Things in Cpp
Using ConstPtr &msg in Callbacks

The ConstPtr is a type alias in ROS that represents a smart pointer (boost::shared_ptr or std::shared_ptr in ROS2) to a constant sensor_msgs::JointState message. This ensures that the message data cannot be modified within the callback function, providing safety and consistency.
