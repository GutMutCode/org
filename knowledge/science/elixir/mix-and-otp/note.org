#+title: Note

* Common use cases
** Processes
+ We need many process => duplicated definition => Bucket
+ We need to separate function to client features and server features => GenServer
** Task
Only execute some code with supervisors
** Agent
To store state to processes (just wrap)
** Bucket
To use many process in one module without duplicated definition.
- buckets are started dynamically based on user input without assign atoms directly. => need Registry
~use Agent~
** Registry
To associate a bucket name to the bucket process [{name, pid}...]
~use GenServer~

Manage process according to specific conditions.
+ Make ~Registry~ which has callbacks to manage processes
** Supervisor
Process that manage another process.

** ETS
In-memory data store for registry
** Testing
~use ExUnit.Case~
+ Use ~start_supervised!~ instead of directly start the ~start_link/1~ function
