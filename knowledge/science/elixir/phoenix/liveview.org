#+title: Liveview

* What is Liveview?
real-time user experiences with server-rendered HTML over HTTP and WebSocket

Handle hundrd-thousands or even millions of WebSocket connections handled by multiple BEAM processes

mounting live views in pages served via Phoenix

** Jose Valim
integration between server and client, allowing it todrastically optimize both latency and bandwidth, leading to user experiences that are faster adn smoother than any other client-server combo out

* How this works?
Defines ~Phoenix.Components~ and the [[file:./heex.org][HEEX]] tempalte engine

used for rendering HTML contents in both regular and real-time applications

Sending tiny [[file:./dom.org][DOM]] diffs of server-rendered HTML over the wire, computed thanks to server-side change tracking

Each ~live view~ being viewed by a specific user (or browser) is backed by a single Erlang VM process
