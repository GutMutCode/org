#+title: Adv Types

* Advanced Types
The Rust type system has some features that we've so far mentioned but haven't yet discussed.
We'll start by discussing newtypes in general as we examine why newtypes are useful as types.
Then we'll move on to type aliases, a feature similar to newtypes but with slightly different semantics.
We'll also discuss the ~!~ type adn dynamically sized types.
