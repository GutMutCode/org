#+title: Control Flow

* If expression
Rust only allow to use a ~bool~ in if expression.
You must be explicit and always provide ~if~ with a Boolean as its condition.
** Using if in a let Statement
Because ~if~ is an expression, we can use it on the right side of a ~let~ statement to assign the outcome to a variable.

* Repeatable
** Kinds
- ~loop~ - repeat until explicitly say to stop it
- ~while~ - conditional loop
- ~for~ - loop for iterator (arrays, maps, etc.)

** Use cases of a loop
- To retry an operation you know might fail, such as checking whether a thread has completed its job.
- To pass the result of that operation out of the loop to the rest of your code.
