* Quality of Service
** QoS 0
fan-out delivery, doesn't matter to the publisher if a message was received by anyone
** QoS 1
at least once delivery, the publisher wants a PUBACK confirmation message + requires persistence
** QoS 2
exactly once delivery, more complex flow consisting of PUBREC, PUBREL and PUBCOMP messages + requires persistence
