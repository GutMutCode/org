* Exponentiation
  An operation involving two numbers,
  the =base= and the =exponent= or =power=.

  It is written as b^n, where =b= is the base and =n= is the power.
  this is pronounced as " =b= (raised) to the (power of) =n= ".

  When ~base~ is a positive integer,
  exponentiation =corresponds= to repeated multiplication of the base
