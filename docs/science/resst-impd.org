#+title: Resst Impd

* Resistance & Impedance
These are both terms that refer to how much a component in an electrical circuit opposes the flow of current.

** Resistance
It applies to direct current (DC) circuits.

*** What's the cause?
- The opposition by the resistive elements in the circuit.

** Impedance
It applies to alternating current (AC) circuits.

- It's a more general concept

*** What's the cause?
- The opposition by the resistive elements in the circuit.
- Reactive elements
  energy in storage ( capacitors )
  magnetic fields ( inductors )

*** Resistance
the real part

*** Reactance
the imaginary part
