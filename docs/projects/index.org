* One For All
** What I want to make
*** Virtual Processing or Virtual Threading ( Inspired by Erlang )
+ For thousand of websockets => full interactive, effective and reasonable webpage ( Inspired by Pheonix framwork in Elixir )
+ Using concurrency, parallel without verbose boilerplate as async, and without any performance cost. ( Inspired by Rust )

*** Using javascript without javascript
+ We need javascript, whereas don't like syntax.

*** Implement all of services, by one language
+ Too many language, too many learning.
+ Create the wheel, but first we need to use the past one. Code compatible and anternating => Refactor purpose language

*** Fault-tolerant
+ We are lazy, so we need ability to choose when we code.
+ By isolate the state of each actor
+ If failure is limited to single actor, the whole system becomes more resilient

*** Multi-model Database (General purpose)
+ In modern programing world, we need multiple database even if our service's main purpose is one.
+ We need general purpose database.

*** Personal Blog
+ Using tailwind
+ Using markdown
+ Do not Using JS
+ As simple as possible

*** Cloud Service
+ Korean Locale specialized service

*** Practical math for programmer ( Inspired by Julia )
+ Math + Programming + Real Work
+ We need to express math formula to the programing language

*** Programming language for Musician

*** Integrate Code to Video Editing
*** Easy Scale up
I don't want to adapt your code at all to scale up.

** What need to make
*** TODO Understand about Virtual Machine for Virtual Processing and Fault-tolerant
**** [ ] Search learning documents and list up
**** [ ] Find who knows this well
**** [ ] Cloning exist virtual machine briefly
***** What through?
****** [[file:./OFA/db/index.org][SQLite clone]] in C

*** TODO Use JS Without JS
**** [ ] Find who already doing this
***** [ ] Start HTMX project
****** How long?
****** What through?
***** [ ] Template language
**** [ ] Search learning documents and list up
***** How long?
***** What through?

*** TODO Understanding programming language's main structure and control flow (by Zig?) => for OFA
**** [ ] Cloning interpreter & compiler in GO => [[file:./OFA/lang/index.org][WIIG & WCIG]]
***** How long?
Until the end
***** What through?
**** [ ] Search learning documents and list up
***** How long?

*** TODO Understanding database's main structure and modern model's purposes => Multi model database
**** [ ] Search learning documents and list up
***** How long?
***** What through?
**** [ ] Cloning existing database briefly
***** How long?
***** What through?
****** [[file:./OFA/db/index.org][toydb]] in Rust

**** [ ] Contribute with opensource database project


*** TODO Apply math to my real work
**** [ ] Make Game

**** [ ] Calculate my personal problem with math

** What focus on
*** Remove black box about what i'm use
