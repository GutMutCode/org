#+title: Intro

* Getting Started
This book will show you how to use Rust's asynchronous programming tools to get the most of your hardware.

** What This Book Covers
This book aims to be a comprehensive, up-to-date guide to using Rust's async language features and libraries, appropriate for beginners and old hands alike.

- The early chapters provide an introduction to async programming in general, and to Rust's particular take on it.

- The midle chapters discuss key utilities and control-flow tools you can use when writing async code, and describe best-practices for structuring libraries and applications to maximize performance and reuseability.

- The last section of the book covers the broader async ecosystem, and provides a number of examples of how to accomplish common tasks.

With that out of the way, let's explore the exciting world of Asynchronous Programming in Rust!
