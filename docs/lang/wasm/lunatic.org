#+title: Lunatic

* Characteristics
Lunatic is written in =Rust= and uses Mozilla's =Wasmtime= to create processes as WebAssembly instances.

* A Rule of Thumb
** Modeling each connection with an actor
You'll get sandboxing per connection and, therefore, additional security.

* Used Library (RUST)
[[file:../rust/lib/tokio.org][Tokio]]
