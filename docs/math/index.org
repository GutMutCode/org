* Math from scratch
** 3Blue1Brown
We have to focus on conceptual part of math, not a computation part

** TOC
*** Algebra (Khan Academy)
Needed for everything that follows

*** Trigometry (Khan Academy)
=Game engines= rely on:
- aiming
- control angle

*** Linear Algebra
file:./linear_algebra.org

=Graphics engine=
- signal processing
- dealing with complex 3D movements and rotations (Linear Algebra Done Right)

*** Calculus
=Game engines= (Khan Academy)
- know how fast a character needs to accelerate =to make it across the screen in ten seconds=
- Air registance
- write low-level functions (multiplication, division, etc.)

**** [[file:./calculus/index.org][Calculus by code]]

*** Number of theory
low-level programming
- understanding hex, binary, decimal conversion
- cryptography

*** Fourier Analysis
- signal processing
- circuits
- interface with electronics

*** Quaternions
make your code more efficient

*** Lambda calculus
do more abstract of theoretical computer science


** Discussion from X
Halmos - [][Naive Set Theory]
Axler - [[file:../books/linear-algebra-done-right/index.org][Linear Algebra Done Right]]

*Goal* - Be able to speak any mathmatician in the world and be able to hold a conversation or understand their contribution for 30 minutes.

Elon musk - Actually we're definitly not smart enough to even know what the right questions are to ask

Tesla AI specialization Chip
- Highly energy optimized
  HW3, 4,5

energy optimizing is extremely important.

More electricity generation
More voltage Transformers
Transformers need Transformers

Dojo - traning efficiency
- memory bandwidth => important for training of LLM

Silicon shortage today
- voltage Transformers shortage
- electricity shortage

"useful compute unit of energy"
