locates and load the boot loader which in turn locates and loads the OS

* How to find information about a specific hardware?
** Datasheet (DS)
- Functional =overview=
- Pin assignment and definition
- Electrical characteristics
- Packaging
- Ordering information

** Reference Manual (RM)
This targets =application= developers.

- how to use the hardware (MCU, memory and peripherals)

** Programming Manual (PM)
This targets application and =system-level software= developers.

- Programming model
- instruction set
- =core= peripherals
