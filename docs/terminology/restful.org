* What is RESTful [[file:./api.org][API]]?
A api that meets Representational State Trasfer [[file:./protocol.org][Protocol]]

A architectural style for designing =networked= applications

* What does RESTful mean?
Restraining data transfer rules for simplicity, scalability and the use of standard HTTP method

** [[file:./stateless.org][Statelessness]]
Each request from a client to a server ~must contain all the information~ needed to understand and process the request

** Resource-Based
Resources in REST must identified by a [[file:./uri.org][URI]]

** Representation
Resources are must can represented in various formats, such as JSON or XML

Client interact with resources by exchanging representations

For examples, a lcient may request a resource in JSON format, and the server responds with the resource's representation in JSON

** Uniform Interface Design
You must use standard HTTP methods for having a uniform and consistent communication

This simplifies the interaction between clients and servers

*** [[file:./httpreq.org][HTTP Methods]]
*** URI Structure
*** Hypermedia as the Engie of Application State (HATEOAS)

* What you should to know
