#+title: Instance

* Definition
** Wikipedia
A [[file:./context.org][context]] which is sharing data structure with other context
Any time a new context is created based on some model, it is said that the model has been instantiated.

In practice, this instance usually has a data structure in common with other instances, but the values stored in the instances are separate.

Changing the values in one instance wil then not interfere with the values of some other instance.
