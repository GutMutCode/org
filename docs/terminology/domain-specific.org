#+title: Domain Specific

* Domain Specific Languages
** Wikipedia
A computer language specialized to a particular application domain.

This is in contrast to a general-purpose language (GPL), which is broadly applicable across domains.

There are a wide variety of DSLs, ranging from widely used languages for common domains, such as HTML for web pages, down to languages used by only one or a few pieces of software, such as ~MUSH~ soft code.
