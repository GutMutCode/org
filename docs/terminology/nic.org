#+title: NIC

* What is the NIC?
=Network Interface Controller= that pluged in Motherboard

It is called Network Adaptor in general desktop

* How does the NIC works?
NIC processes the [[file:./ethernet.org][Ethernet frame]] and prepares it for transmission over the =physical medium= (e.g., Ethernet cable or wireless channel)

Converting the =digital data= into =electrical signals= or radio waves suitable for the specific network medium and also does oppositely

** Buffer Memory
To temporarily store incoming and outgoing network [[file:./packet.org][packets]]

*** Receive Buffer
Incoming network packets are stored in this before they are processed by the operating system

*** Transmit Buffer
Outgoing network packets are stored in this before being sent onto the network

** Descriptor Rings
A data structures that point to the location of receive and transmit buffers in memory

It's used to eficiently manage and process incoming and outgoing packets

** Control Structure

** Direct Memory Access (DMA)
A way to transfer data without involving the CPU

NIC often use this method
