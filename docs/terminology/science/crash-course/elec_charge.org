#+title: Electric Charge

* Static electricity
It occurs when an object obtains a net amount of positive or negative =electric charge=
It creating an imbalance that want to be returned to equilibrium

** To understand Electricity
*** Atom
**** Charged particles
- It contains *positive charge: protons* and *nagative charge: electrons*

generally there's an equal number of each
= the net electric charge of the atom is 0
= electrically neutral

***** In solid
protons -> stay fixed
electrons -> some are free to move around

****** Moving electron - =free electrons=
- reside in atom's outer shell as valence electrons
- are easily plucked off and carried around, when acted upon by an `outside force`

******* How easy to move around
It's depend on materials

******** Conductors
It lets free electrons move freely throughout the solid (like copper)

******** Insulators
It holds on to them tightly, limiting their flow (like wood)

******* What causes these charged particles to move in the first place?
An imbalance of electrical charge
- some part of an object has a different number of free electrons than another part.

Too many electrons
Missing free electrons

******* How to make charged materials?
******** Charging by friction
 friction will make charged materials, but

********* Law of conservation of electric charge
- You can never create electric charge
- Charge can only move from one place to another
