#+title: PWM

* What is the PWM?
Pulse Width Modulation

A technique used to control the amount of power delivered to an electrical device by varying the width of the pulse in a pulse signal

It is commonly used in applications live motor control, LED dimming, and audio signal generation.

In PWM, a digital signal alternates between on and off states.

** "On" time (or width of pulse)
It's adjusted (modulated) to control the effective power.

The ratio of the "On" time to the total period of the signal is called the =duty cycle=

A higher duty cycle means the signal is "on" for a longer portion of each cycle, delivering more power.


** "Off" time
