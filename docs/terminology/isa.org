#+title: Instructions Set Architecture

* Definition
The architectures that are constituted set of instructions that available on a Computer (e.g., CPU, architecture, platform)

=Set of instruction = Machine Code=

** Versus Microarchitecture

microarchitecture implements ISA

*** Different microarchitecture can implement the same ISA
Intel's & AMD's microarchitecture implement essentialy the same ISA

*** Backward compatibility
There's many weired corner-case and historical artifacts because of the backward compatibility

Even the latest ISA of microarchitecture, Haswell's ISA, still has most of the instructions in the very first generation of X86, and anything in between
