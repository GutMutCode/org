#+title: OpenSSL

* What is OpenSSL?
open-source software library that provides a toolkit for implementing the Transport Layer Security [[file:./ssl_tls.org][(TLS)]] and Secure Sockets Layer protocols.

These protocols are widely used to secure communication over a computer network, such as the internet

includes various cryptographic algorithms and utilities

* Features
** Encryption and Decryption
*** symmetric-key algorithms
AES

*** asymmetric-key algorithms
RSA

*** hash functions
SHA-256

** SSL/TLS implementation

** Certificate Handling
Manage a certificates, including creation, signing, and verification of X.509 certificates

** Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
Manage a Public Key Infrastructure, which is a set of roles, policies, and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, and revoke digital certificates

** Command-Line Utilities
Allow users to perform cryptographic operations, generate key pairs, create and verify digital signature, and more

** Cross-Platform Support
OpenSSL is designed to be portable and can be used on various operating systems,
