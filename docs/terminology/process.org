* What is Process?
The program on memory = loaded program = instance of the program

These processes are executed by CPU core always if the computer running

Each process runs in its own isolated environment, and it is managed by the [[file:./os.org][operating system]]

* Program Execution
A process beigins when a [[file:./execution.org][program]] is loaded into memory and starts

* Process Communication
Inter-process a communication (IPC) mechanism, such as pipes, shared memory, and message queues

* Process Termination
A process can terminated either by completing its execution or by
explicitly being terminated by the operating system or another process

When the process is terminated, the operating system releases its allocated resources and update relevant data structures

* Parent-Child Processes
In many operating systems, a process can create new processes known as child processes

These child processes inherit certain characteristics from their parent and they can exectued independently
