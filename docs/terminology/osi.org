#+title: OSI

* What is OSI?
Open System Interconnection ~for the standard of network~

Separating network communication flow according to managed data structure

** Layer 1
Hardware boundary that manage signal of such as light, switch, electronic sign, etc

** Layer 2
Software boundary that manage [[file:./ethernet.org][Ethernet Frame]] / Ethernet Protocol / In [[file:./nic.org][NIC]]

** Layer 3
Software boundary that is reponsible for routing, logical addressing, and forwarding data between different networks

[[file:./packet.org][Packet]] / IP / In NIC

** Layer 4
Software boundary that is responsible for data transmission - All actions are performed by ~os~

[[file:./segment.org][Segment]], Datagram / TCP, UDP / In NIC

** Layer 5
Software boundary that manage [[file:./session.org][Session]] - From this layer, all actions are performed by application ~processes~

In contemporary networking, the session layer has become less prominent
- It's often handled by application layer (6) or transport layer (3, 4)

** Layer 6
Software boundary that is responsible for translating data between the application layer and the lower layers

Presentatin Layer
- Convert various form reqeusts into integrated form structure
- Convert intregated form data into various form fit to specific application

*** data formatting
Character [[file:./encoding.org][encoding]]

*** encryption
[[file:./ssl_tls.org][SSL/TLS]]

*** compression
JPEG

** Layer 7
Software boundary that is responsible for interacting with end-user application

App Request -> all request must managed identically

[[file:./http.org][HTTP]]
