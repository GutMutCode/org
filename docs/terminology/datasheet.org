** AX
Address line X

It used to select memory locations or specific registers.

** ADX
Analog-to-Digital Converter Channel X

This pin is used for inputting analog signals, which are converted to digital values by the ADC.

** ADCX
Analog-to-Digital Converter Channel X

Similar to ADX, this pin is used for analog signal input, but it corresponds to channel X of the ADC.

** AVCC
Analog Voltage Supply

This is supply pin for the analog portion of the microcontroller, typically connected to the same voltage as VCC but with added filtering

** AINX
Analog Comparator Negative Input X

This pin is used as the negative input to the analog comparator, which compares two voltages.

** ALE
~Address Latch~ Enable

This pin is used to =latch= the lower byte of the address bus in microcontroller systems, particularly in systems with an external memory interface.

** AREF
Analog ~Reference Voltage~

This pin is used to provide a reference voltage for the ADC, against which the input voltages are compared.

** CLKO
Clock Output

This pin outputs the system clock signal, which can be used to synchronize external devices

** VCC
Voltage Common Collector

This pin is the power supply voltage pin for the microcontroller, typically +5V or +3.3V depending on the system.

** GND
Ground

This pin is the ~reference point~ for the voltage supply and the common ground for the circuit.

** SCL
Serial Clock Line

This pin is used in ~I2C~ communication to carry the clock signal, synchronizing the communication between devices.

** SDA
Serial Data Line

This pin is used in ~I2C~ communication for data transfer between devices.

** SS
Slave Select

This pin is used in ~SPI~ communication to select the slave device.

** INTX
External Interrupt X

This pin is used to trigger an external interrupt, allowing external devices to interrupt the microcontroller's main program.

** ICPX
Input Capture Pin X

This pin is used for input capture in timers, recording the value of a timer at the moment ~an external event~ is detected.

** MISO
Master Out Slave Out

This pin is used in ~SPI~ communication to transfer data from the slave device to the master.

** MOSI
Master Out Slave In

This pin is used in ~SPI~ communication to transfer data from the master device to the slave

** OCXY
Output Compare X(num) Y(alpha)

This pin is used in ~PWM~ to output a signal when the timer matches a certain value.

- 값을 정함
- 타이머가 정해진 값에 도달하면 해당핀이 변함 (0 or 1)

** PGX
Port G pin X

This refers to a specific pin X on Port G of the microcontroller. Each port typically controls multiple GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins.

** PCINTX
Pin Change Interrupt X

This pin can trigger an interrupt on a change of state (high-to-low or low-to-high) on pin X

** RESET
This pin used to reset the microcontroller, restarting the program execution from the beginning.

** RD (with -)
This pin is used to trigger a read operation, typically in memory-mapped I/O systems, where the microcontroller reads data from a peripheral.

** RXDX
Receive Data X(num)

This pin is used to receive data in serial communication, such as ~UART~

** TXDX
Transmit Data X(num)

This pin is used to transmit data in serial communication, such as ~UART~

** TX
Timer X Input

This pin is used as an external input to Timer X, which can count external events.

** TOSC
Timer Oscillator

This pin is used to connect an external oscillator for the timer/counter subsystem, often used in real-time clocks.

** WR (with -)
This pin is used to trigger a write operation, typically in memory-mapped I/O systems, where the microcontroller writes data to a peripheral.

** XCKX
External Clock X(num)

This pin is used as an external clock source for synchronous serial communication, such as USART.

** XTAL1
This is one of the two used to connect an external crystal oscillator to provide the clock signal for the microcontroller.
The other pin is typically labeled XTAL2
