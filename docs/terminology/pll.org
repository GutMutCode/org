#+title: PLL

* Phase-Locked Loops
A feedback control system that generates a clock signal with a higher frequency than the input clock source.

In microcontrollers, PLLs are used to multiply the base clock frequency, providing the flexibility to run the microcontroller at higher speeds without needing an external high-frequency clock.

** Clock multiplication
Increases the frequency of the input clock, allowing the microcontroller to run at higher clock speeds, improving performance.

** Frequency stability
Ensures that the generated clock is stable and synchronized with the reference clock.

** Fine-tunning
Allows precise control over clock frequency to meet the timing requirements of different parts of the system.
