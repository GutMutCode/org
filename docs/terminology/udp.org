* What is a UDP?
User Datagram Protocol

* How does UDP work?
UDP allow all data from others
So, unlike [[file:./tcp.org][TCP]], UDP send data ~without acknowledge~

** Receiver & Sender
All computers using UDP are have receiver and sender

*** Receiver
Receive all of data from others

*** Sender
Send data to other computer

** Method of transmission
*** Uni-Casting
~What does Uni mean in this term?~

Specifying a IP address and transfer data to it

*** Broad-Casting
Specifying a group of computers and transfer data to them

* Advantages
** Transfering many of data
1. streaming services
2. telephone services

** Transfering to many of computers at once (BroadCasting)
1. streaming services
2. telephone services
3. Domain Name Server ([[file:./dns.org][DNS]])
4. Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
   Like a local network

* Child Protocol
** Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
This help to build a environment for real-time transmission such as video/audio call services

* What is form of data used in UDP?
** Datagram
UDP packet has a meaning as itself, and this is called the Datagram.

* What are differences with TCP?
Unlike TCP, UDP doesn't have ~Flow control~

** 멀티미디어 데이터 전송
일부가 손실되어도 문제되지 않는다.

** 실시간 서비스
빠른 전송속도가 중요하다.

*** Is the UCP really faster than the TDP?
**** No Handshaking
**** No Gaurantee

** 데이터 경계가 존재한다
UDP must have to 입력함수 호출 횟수 == 출력함수 호출 횟수
- Datagram Data

TCP shouldn't have to 입력함수 호출 횟수 != 출력함수 호출 횟수
- Stream Data
