#+title: Motor

* How to control motor?
** Software Considerations
*** Control Logic
Define Up/Down positions (retract/extend)
Use _PWM signals_ to control speed/position if supported by the actuator

*** Feedback Mechanism (if needed)
Use _limit switches_ to detect end positions
_Potentiometers or encoders_ to measure position (if precise control is required)

*** Microcontroller Code
Use _timers_ to generate =PWM signals= or control =stepper pulses=.
Implement _H-Bridge logic_ (e.g. forward/reverse control for DC motors)
If using I2C/SPI, communicate with a dedicated motor controller module

*** Safety Considerations
**** Current Limiting
Avoid overloading the actuator

What's this mean?

**** Debounce Logic
If using limit switches, debounce them to avoid false triggers.

**** Emergency Stop
Implement a button or software logic to stop movement immediately

*** Smoothens Considerations
#+begin_quote
The techniques that _gradually adjust_ the speed rather than abruptly starting or stopping the actuator.

- reduce mechanical stress
- prevents wear or system failures

**** Accelerating
***** Speed Control with PWM
****** You can control the speed by varying the duty cycle
- Start with a low duty cycle
- Gradually increase it to accelerate smoothly

****** If the actuator's motor driver supports _variable speed_
Use analog control or PWM input

****** Example Logic
Start at 10% PWM duty cycle & increase to 100% in steps

***** Acceleration Profile
Implement ramping logic to control acceleration and deceleration

ramping: The ways to change the duty cycle over time

****** Linear ramp
Increase speed gradually in fixed steps (constant rate over time)

****** Exponential ramp
Faster acceleration at later stages (accel: __-^)

****** S-curve ramp
Smooth start and stop for soft transitions (accel: ____-^-____)

***** Timers and Delays
Use microcontroller timers to control the rate at which PWM duty cycles change.

A timer interrupt can adjust PWM values periodically to create smooth acceleration.
