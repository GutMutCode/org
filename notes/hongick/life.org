* Life & Death

* If you are a real philosopher
You must pursue death and dying
You must appreciate your death

** How do you want to death?
How to die?
Not how fast to die
Death, not suicide

** What are the nature wants?

*** efficiency
Human brain like increasing of efficiency

*** to spread humanity

*** to acquire knowledge

** About human body
human body is inaccurate to get a ~knowledge~ (the truth)

The things that you cannot see and hear, but you know it exists

** What is me exactly?

* Socrates's thinking
The truth is obtained when you think about only single one thing apart of the body as possible.

As long as you are infected on body, you cannot be satisfied.

The body keep interrupting your pursuing of the truth.

The not pure things cannot close to a pure thing
