* Animation
** Anim Curves
*** Expression
time (current frame - mutable)
-
RenderStart (object's start frame - immutable)
/
FrameFormat.Rate (project's frame rate - immutable) / 2

#+begin_src davinci resolve
iif
(
  ((time-comp.RenderStart) / (comp:GetPrefs().Comp.FrameFormat.Rate) / 2) < 1,
  ((time-comp.RenderStart) / (comp:GetPrefs().Comp.FrameFormat.Rate) / 2),
  1
)
#+end_src

* Green Bar
Indicates which parts of the current selected tool are cached to RAM

- Fusion know freeze frames or static images and calculate only once.

* Expression
Can be used to ~get a dynamic value~

Function in Programming Langauge
#+begin_quote
The value of the size control on a Transform tool
#+end_quote

** Rule
#+begin_quote
Name.Control

Transform2.Size
#+end_quote


* The things we have to avoid (aware)
** Requesting the value of a control frame by frame
If you don't need ~dynamic detecting (detect frame by frame)~,

instanciate a tool or Publish a control ~for direct connecting~

** Fusion can't change multiple controls/parameters at once

If there are many things to change, You need to change them ~manualy one by one~
- Or use Change String Scripts

** If Expression output a text or a state/boolean
It will be quite difficult to fix an error, if you can't see the output of the Expression

-> Use Text+ tool for read ou the state of every kind of expression

** Disable effects when HiQ mode is disabled
To enhance playhead's performance
