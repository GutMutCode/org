- Join foreign community that you want

* Syntax
** WHEN
*** To and For
**** When to use ~to~
     - When the reason or purpose is a verb.
**** When to use ~for~
     - When the reason or purpose is a noun.
     - Cut if you see ~verb~ after ~for~
*** In and On
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    In and on are prepositions that are used to ~describe location~, among other things
    There are simple rules that will help you choose between in and on for location,
    although naturally there are exceptions to the rules.
    #+END_QUOTE
**** When to use ~in~ 
     Use in when something is ~located inside~ of a defined space.
     It could be flat space, like a yard, or a three-dimensional space, like a box, house, or car.
     The space does not need to be closed on all sides
     (There is water ~in~ the glass)
     - With situation, time, case..
**** When to use ~on~ 
     Use on when something is ~touching the surface~ of something.
     It could be a horizontal surface, like a floor or beach, or a vertical surface, like a wall
     (There hung pictures ~on~ the wall)
     We also use ~on~ for the surfaces of body parts (He has a tatto ~on~ his arm)
**** Difference
     - There is someone ~in~ my bed.
     - There is a book ~on~ my bed.

**** Exceptions
     1. Although we use ~in~ with cars, use ~on~ for larger vehicles,
        like planes, trains, and buses 
        ("They have wifi ~on~ the plane").
     2. To talk about something that is part of a written document, use ~in~,
        regardless of the format of the document 
        ("The quote appeared ~in~ a blog post")
     3. With websites, use ~on~

*** As and Like
    =As= and =Like= are often confused since they can both be used for comparisons.
    There are, however, important differences.
**** Making comparisons
***** as + adjective + as and as much as
     We often use the structure =as + adjective + as= or =as much as= to say if something has,
     or doesn't have, =the same amount= of that quality as something else.

     - She loves curry as much as i do.
     - He's not as tall as his brother.
     - It's not as expensiv as the other hotel.
     - That dog is as big as that child!

     You also have to use as in the expression the same as.

     - Your phone is the same as mine.
     - Texting is not the same as speaking in person.


***** like + noun
      In the following comparisons, 
      like is followed by a =noun= or a =pronoun= to say that two things are =similar=.

      - He's like a fahter to me.
      - She's acting like a child.
      - It's like a burger but with big mushrooms instead of bread.
      - There are lots of people like us.

      It is also common to make comparisons using =like= with =verbs= of the senses.

      - She =looks= like her mother.
      - It =sounds= like a cat.
      - Nothing =tastes= like homemade lemonade.
      - It =smells= like medicine.
      - It =feels= like cotton.

***** as if/ as though + clause
      As if and as though can be used to compare a real situation to an imaginary situation.
      They are followed by a clause (a subject and verb).

      - You look as if you've seen a ghost.
      - I felt as if i was floating above the ground.
      - You talk as though we're never going to see each other again.

**** Examples
     I worked =as= an actor for two years.
     I went home early =as= i felt ill.
     He looks =as= if he hasn't slept.
     =As= you know, this is the third time i've had to complain.
     He looks =like= his dad.
     She's =like= a sister to me.
     Try to do something relaxing, =like= reading a book or having a bath.

*** When to use ~get~ with =past completive verb=
*** Only and Also
**** When to use ~only~ with =verb=
     - Before verb?
**** When to use ~also~ with =verb=
     - After verb?
*** When to use ~a, an, the~
*** When to use ~that, which~
** HOW
*** How to use ~only~
    - Only take a message if it done?

*** How to use the =have=
    The verb have is used as an auxiliary verb.
    - She =has= =run= a lovely, deep, bubble bath.
    - Katie =had= =read= about the concert in the newspaper.

    and also as a main verb.
    - She is =having= a bath at the moment.
    - The driver has =had= his breakfast, so we can go.


* Warning
** WHEN
*** When you use ~verb~
    - Consider time
*** When you use ~noun~
    - Consider a, an, and the
* Words
** Domain
   /An area of territory =owned= or =controlled= by a ruler of government./
*** In several domains.
*** To particular domains.
* Common usage
** stands for ~
** ~ at hand
** whether ~ or not
** tells =Noun=
** bitch about ~
   ~ 에 대해서 욕을 하다.
** while we are on the ~
   ~ 하는 동안
** 1 together that 2
   - 2 인 1 ( 꾸미기 )
** This is NAME speaking.
   - 지금 제가 말하고 있습니다
* Jupyter
** 품사
   /Types/
   -  명사, 형용사, 부사, 전치사...
** 명사와 명사구
   Noun = N = n
   공간적인 대상 = computer, pencil, cat, .. god, love, evil, ... korea, Japan
   명사 == 코딩언어의 object

*** 종류
    1. 구체적인 형태가 있는 대상 : desk, pencil,cup...
    2. 개념적인 대상 : dream, idea, purpose, goal
*** 대화의 기본 단위 => 문장 (sentence)

    문장
    - 하나 이상의 ~품사~ 들의 조합
    - 하나 이상의 절로 구성

      명사가 문장 내에 쓰일때 => 반드시 명사구의 형태로 쓰인다.

    명사 => 명사구(noun phrase = np = NP) => 절(clause)의 요소

    I(명사구) like Haskell(명사구)

    Give me(n) an(?) apple(n)

    명사구 = 관사 + (형) + 명사 + (형)
** 관사
   /어떤 대상의 숫자 표현/
*** 예제
    one flower, two flowers, three flowers
**** 특정되지 않은
     - one flower => a flower
     - many flowers => (zero) flowers
**** 우리가 모두 아는 (그..)
     - one flower which both you and me know => the flower
     - many flower which both you and me know => the flowers

*** 종류
** 대명사에 관사가 없는 이유
   명사는 반드시 명사구의 형태로 사용

   Give me ~an apple~
   Give me ~apples~
   Give me ~two apples~

   단어(명사) => 문장속에 삽입 => 명사구

   왜 me 앞에는 관사가 없을까?
   - 부정관사인가?
     - 정해져 있으므로 부정관사는 아님.

       There is a red apple on the table. It is from Jane for me.
   It = a red apple

   ~명사구~ 를 대신하는 단어들 = ~대명사~
** 형용사
   Adjective
*** 규칙
    1. 명사구에 포함
       - a ~beautiful red~ flower
         명사 앞 && 관사 뒤 || 명사 뒤
    2. 동사구를 보충
       - this flower is ~beautiful~
         동사구 뒤
    3. 선택적 사용
** 동사구
   명사구
* Curious
** 번역기를 돌려봤을때는 의미가 맞다고 나오는데, 내가 작문한 내용이 정말 외국사람들이 일반적으로 사용하는 문장인지 의구심이 든다.
   - 실제로 외국인에게 사용해본다.
   - 외국인에게 물어본다.
     - 어디서 물어봄? => ~외국 커뮤니티~
   - 자연스럽다는 것은 무엇인가?
     일반적으로 통용되는 것 (옳고 그름을 의미하지는 않음)
