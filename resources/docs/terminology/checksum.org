#+title: Checksum

* What is Checksum?
A small-sized block of data derived from another block of digital data =for the purpose of detecting errors= that may have been introduced during its transmission or storage

Checksums are ofthen used to verify =data integrity= but are not relied upon to verify =data authenticity=

* How it works?
A general idea behind a checksum is to use a mathematic algorithm to generate a fixed-size value(checksum) based on content of the data

** Common Checksum Algorithm
*** Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
- Dividing the data into blocks
- Performing polynomial division to generate checksum

*** Checksums using Hash Functions
Hash functions like MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256 can be used to generate checksums
This algorithm generate fixed-size hash value based on the entire content of the data

*** Parity Bits
In simple cases, parity bits used as checksums
Even or odd parity bits can be employed
