#+title: RPC

* What is RPC?
Remote Procedure Call

This can be accociated with the session layer, it often relies on lower-level protocols, such as TCP/IP, for the actual communication between devices

A protocol that allows a program to cause a procedure to execute on ~another address space~ (commonly on another machine)

#+begin_src vbnet
Client: CALL add(3, 5)
Server: RETURN 8
#+end_src

- Client is making an RPC call to a remote server
- Asking it to execute the "add" procedure with argument 3 and 5
