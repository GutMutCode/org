#+title: Container

* History
** The traditional way a business operates
*** One application on one server
The OS didn't have the capability to run multiple application ~securely~ on a single server

**** They would have buy a new server for it to run on
Application couldn't take full advantage of a server's capability

*** Multiple VM on one server
**** Hardware(Server)
**** Hypervisor
file:./hypervisor.org
**** Virtual Machine
file:./vm.org

* Container
An application that's been packaged with all the:
- Files
- Configurations
- Dependencies
- necessary for it run

** So,
This can be hosted without any files, configuration, dependencies, and any other necessary it run

* How to manage Container?
By use a software like ~docker~

* Structure
** Hardware(Server)
** Operating System
** Container Engine
a software that unpacks the container files and hands them off to the operating system kernel

This allows applications to share the host operating system
- Can resolve hypervisor's disadvantages

* Disadvantages
** Container files must be matched with the Host operating system
** If Host Operating System goes crash,
then all containers will go down

* Main difference with VM
Only contain an application
