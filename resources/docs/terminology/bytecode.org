* What is Bytecode?
One of the [[file:./ir.org][IR]]

It is called `bytecode` because it consists of compact, binary instructions that are ~typically one byte in size~

Like some other IRs, bytecode read by [[file:./vm.org][Virtual Machine]] and compiled into specific machine code

* Kinds of Bytecode
** Java JVM's Bytecode
Can be read by Java [[file:./runtime.org][Runtime]] (written in C/C++)

** Python PVM's Bytecode
Can be read by Python Runtime (written in C)

** Erlang BEAM's Bytecode
Can be read by Erlang Runtime (written in C)

** Javascript's Bytecode

- written in C/C++ (chrome V8, Nitro, NodeJS...)
