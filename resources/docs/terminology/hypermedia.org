#+title: Hypermedia

* Definition
An extension of the term hypertext, is a nonlinear medium of information that includes graphics, audio, video, plain text and hyperlinks.

This designation contrast with the broader term multimedia, which may include non-interactive linear presentations as well as hypermedia.

The World Wide Wed is a classic example of hyprmedia to access web content,
whereas a non-interactive cinema presentation is an example of standard multimedia due to the absence of hyperlinks.
