#+title: Gateway

* Gateway
A device or software program that connects and translates data between different networks, allowing them to communicate and share information

It's operated in L3 of the [[file:./osi.org][OSI]]

Commonly used to connect networks that use different communication [[file:./protocol.org][protocols]]

* API Gateway
Client send an HTTP request to the API gateway

The API gateway parses and validates the attributes in the HTTP request

The API gateway performs allow-list/deny-list checks

The API gateway talks to an identity provider for authentication and authorization

The rate limiting rules are applied to the request.
If it is over the limit, the request is rejected

The request has passed basic checks,
the API gateway finds the relevant service to route to by path matching

The API gateway transforms the request into the appropriate protocol and sends it to backend microservices

The API gateway can handle errors properly, and deals with faults if the error takes a longer time to recover (circuit break)
It can also leverage [[file:./elk.org][ELK (Elastic-Logstash-Kibana)]]
