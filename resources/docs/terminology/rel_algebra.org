#+title: Relational Algebra

* What is Relational Algebra?
A theoretical framework and a set of operations used to manimupate and query relational databases

to provide a formal and mathematical way to express operations on relations, which are tables in a relational database

to provide a foundation for relational database query languages, like SQL

* Basic Operations
** Selection (sigma)
Selects rows from a relation(table) that satisfy a specified condition

#+begin_example
sigma_age>30(employees)

selects rows from the "employees" table where the age is greater than 30
#+end_example


** Projection (pie)
Selects specific columns from a relation, discarding the others

#+begin_example
pie_name, salary(employees)

selects only the "name" and "salary" columns from the "employees" table
#+end_example

** Union (upsilon)
Combines two relations, removing duplicates

#+begin_example
R upsilon S
#+end_example
