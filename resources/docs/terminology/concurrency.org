#+title: Concurrency

* What is concurrency in programming?
The ability that deals with the execution of multiple tasks (or processes) at the same time

This tipically indicate parallel, with the goal of improving overall system efficiency and performance

multicore processors and distributed systems can achieve this

* Key concepts of concurrency
** Concurrency
The ability of a program to execute multiple tasks at the same time

** Parallelism
The simultaneous execution of multiple tasks using multiple processors or cores
(The real efficiency)

** Thread
file:./thread.org
Threads are a very =common= unit that is applied concurrency

** Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)
A synchronization mechanism that ensures only one thread can access a shared resource at a time

- to prevent data corruption or inconsistency

** Semaphore
'mark, sign, token' (sema) + 'bearer, carrier' (phore)

A synchronization primitive

- to controls access to a shared resource
- by ~limiting the number of threads~ that can access it simultaneously

** Deadlock
A situation where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock

- theses threads are unable to proceed permanently
