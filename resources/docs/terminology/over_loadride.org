#+title: Overload & Override

* A Context of this page
The overload and override is related in object-oriented programming
This two concepts are related to [[file:./polymorphism.org][polymorphism]], which allow objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class

* What is Overload?
define multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameter lists

- you can call different featured methods by the same name
- this provide flexibility in handling different types or numbers of parameters

** When does this run?
In compile-time, compiler determines which method to invoke based on the number or types of arguments

* What is Override?
define a method that is named as the parent class's method name into subclass

- to provide subclass a specific implementation for that named method

** When does this run?
In runtime, process determines which method to invoke based on the hierarchy of classes
