* What is BIOS?
A [[file:./firmware.org][firmware]] used to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs and to perform hardware initilization during the [[file:./boot.org][booting]] process ~when the computer starts~

BIOSes are exist in many hardware of computer such as motherboard's BIOS ROM, gpu, etc

Conventionally BIOS indicate motherboard's BIOS (called system BIOS)

* How does BIOS(system) works?
When BIOS starts, it performs 4 tasks

** Power-On Self Test (POST)
Ensure the computer meets requirements to boot up properly

Checking error by testing itself and if there are fatal errors, the boot process stops and create beep sound

** Looks for video card's BIOS and executed
The BIOS that initialize video card

- normally found at location C000h
- most morden video cards display information on the screen about the video card

** Looks for other device's BIOS and executed
The BIOS that initialize for that device

- Normally, the IDE/ATA hard disk BIOS will be found at C8000h and exectued

** Display its startup screen

** More Testing
memory count-up test
- If BIOS encounters error at this point, error messages are displayed on the screen

** Perform system inventory
Determine what sort of hardware is in the system

- determine memory timing
- set hard drive parameters and access modes

** Detect Plug and Play devices

** Display its summary

** Search for a drive to boot from
Boot according to boot sequence BIOS setting (floppy disk - A:, hard disk - C:, usb, etc)

** Looks for boot information from it
*** From the hard disk
If it is searching a hard disk, it looks for a [[file:./boot.org][master boot record]] at cylinder 0, head 0, sector 1 (the first sector on the disk)

*** From the floppy disk
It looks at the same address on the floppy disk for a volume boot sector

** Boot operating system
With information in boot sector, BIOS loads [[file:./boot.org][bootloader]] into memory

If no boot device at all can be found, the system will normally display an erro message and then freeze up the system

* For Now
It is being replaced these days with [[file:./efi.org][EFI]] firmware

* Procedure
loads and executes the first sector of the disk it decide to boot from (tipically =the first hard disk detected=)

By convention the first sector of a hard disk, called the Master Boot Record(MBR),
- contains a [[file:./storage.org][DOS]] partition table listing the location of the partitions on the disk,
- leaves some space for the boot loader
