#+title: Relations And Functions

* Coordinate Systems (좌표)
** rectangular coordinate system
x-axis
y-axis

floating point

*** quadrants
**** one
x: positive
y: positive
**** two
x: negative
y: positive
**** three
x: negative
y: negative
**** four
x: positive
y: negative

*** Where the x and y axis meet - origin
point(0, 0)

*** World problems
miles or kilometers

liters per kilometer

**** miles per gallon
How far I was getting on a gallon of gas?

we'll be able to control the ~speed~ as a driver -> speed : independent variable

efficiency of the car : dependent variable

*** Input/Output - equation(방정식)
**** Input
what numbers are you putting into the equation

**** Output
your answers, what the equation is geving out to you

*** Domain/Range
**** Domain (영역)
Domain is going to be the ~Input~, or the ~Independent variable~, or just the ~x coordinate~

The horizontal movement along the graph
**** Range (범위)
The range values are your ~Output~, the ~Dependent variable~, or just simply the ~y coordinate~

The virtical movement along the vertical axis of our coordinate system

** polar coordinate system
** imaginary type system


* Functions
/Each x has only one y/

Special type of relation

A set of all orderd pairs such that
each element (number)
in the domain (your input or the x's)
corresponds to only one y (or only one dependent variable)

Each element in the domain corresponds to one element in the range.

Independent for the x
Dependent for the y

* Relations
One, some, or all of the x's
in your set of points
or in your graph
can have more than one y

All set of ordered pairs

* Functions vs Relations
** quadrilateral (사각형)
** rectangle (직사각형)
** square (정사각형)

** sides (변)
** ellipse/oval (타원)

* Graphical Comparison
** Vertical line test (tools to determine whether graph is a function)
If you can draw a vertical line through a graph
and it only crosses the graph once,
no matter where you draw that vertical line, *it is a function.*

If not, *it is a relation*

vertical line in graph

x = # -> only crosses the graph once -> corresponds to only one y => this is a function

x = # -> crosses the graph more than once -> corresponds to multiple y => this is a relation

** piecewise function
*** slope (기울기)
*** parabola (포물선)
*** ends with a hole, opened dot (less than #)
*** start with solid dot (greater than # and equals)

* How do we tell the difference between a relation and a function if we don't have the coordinates and we don't have a graph

Y as a function of x
or Y in terms of X

Get these solved for y

** polynomial (다항)

** x being raised to power of two (X의 2제곱)

** leading (선행하는)

** coefficient (계수)

** parabola
*** opened up
*** opened down

** plug an x (X를 대입하다)
